                <p class="title">Neutrino oscillation parameters: Present status and future roadmap</p>
                <p class="abstract">
                    Marvelous world-class experiments involving neutrinos from the Sun, the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, nuclear reactors and accelerators have firmly established neutrino flavour oscillations. This implies that neutrinos have mass and they mix with each other, providing evidence for physics beyond the Standard Model. The most recent development in this field is the discovery of the smallest lepton mixing angle _13. This signifies an important breakthrough in validating the standard three-flavour oscillation picture of neutrinos. In this talk, the present status of the neutrino oscillation parameters will be reviewed, and the scope of addressing the remaining fundamental unknowns, in particular, the type of the neutrino mass hierarchy, the possible presence of a CPviolating phase in the neutrino sector, and octant degeneracy of _23 in current and future long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments will be discussed. The role of the upcoming India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project to resolve the fundamental issue of neutrino mass ordering will be mentioned.
