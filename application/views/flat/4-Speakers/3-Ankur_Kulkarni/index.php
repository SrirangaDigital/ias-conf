            <span class="abstract">Abstract</span><br />
                A fundamental problem in stochastic control and information
                theory is to provide tight lower bounds on the minimum cost attainable in a
                system. This problem is theoretically well understood under classical
                settings – those that assume infinite memory – but is plagued by a lack
                of tools for attack in nonclassical settings. We explain this phase change
                from convex-analytic perspectives and develop new attacks on this problem.
                We argue that common to such settings is a fundamental nonconvexity that
                germinates from the nonclassicality of the information structure. Using
                convex relaxations and linear programming duality we obtain tight lower
                bounds for problems studied in information theory. This work hopes to
                derive a convex-analytic means of understanding problems with various
                information structures.
