                Anion recognition by synthetic receptors has received increasing attention for its importance in environment, industrial and health-related issues. Thus, the fundamental chemistry of selective recognition, sensing and extraction of various anions in aqueous medium are considered to be very important to develop technologies in water purification process and industrial and nuclear waste reprocessing. A successful approach for developing receptors that selectively bind fluoride, cyanide, arsenate, nitrate, sulfate, phosphates, etc., in aqueous medium is one of the major challenges in anion chemistry. In this regard, a wide variety of receptors (ligands) containing different anion recognition elements with increasing complexities have been developed by the speakerâ€™s team, which will be briefly presented in this talk. The focus will be on their recent work which deals with (i) selective sensing of phosphates; (ii) separation of hydrated metal sulphates/potassium bromide; and (iii) halogen-bonding-assisted bromide removal.
