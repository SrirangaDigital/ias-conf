                Some classical formulae that one usually  encounters in a first course in calculus will be first mentioned. For example, Euler proved in 1730s that  the sum of reciprocals of the squares of all positive integers is one sixth the 
                square of the number Ï€. Such formulae are the prototypical examples for an entire  area of research in modern number theory that goes by the appellation  "special values of L-functions". The aim of this talk is  to provide glimpses into  this area of research and to convey the grandeur of this subject that draws  upon several different areas of modern mathematics such as representation theory,  algebraic and differential geometry, and harmonic analysis.
