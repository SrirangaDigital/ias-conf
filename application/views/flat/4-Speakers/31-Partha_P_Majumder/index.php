                Only about 10% of cells associated with a human body are human cells; the remaining 90% are cells of microorganisms. In 2001, Joshua Lederberg coined the term <i>microbiome</i> to “signify the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space and have been all but ignored as determinants of health and disease.” The human microbiome contributes to our health and well-being, and causes disease. In recent years, considerable understanding has emerged on the nature and extent of human microbiome diversity. The understanding of the relationship of “our second genome” with that of our own genome is just beginning to emerge. This Symposium will focus on some recent advances.
