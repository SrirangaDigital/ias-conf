            <span class="abstract">Abstract</span><br />
                Over the last two decades, low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy has emerged as one of the most powerful tools to study electronic properties of solids at low temperature, with unsurpassed spatial and energy resolution. In this talk, the basics of this technique and the low temperature scanning tunneling microscope developed in TIFR, operating down to 350 mK in a field up to 90 kOe, will be described. Using specific examples from the studies carried out in the speakerâ€™s laboratory, the kind of problems that can be addressed using this technique will be highlighted.  That it is much more economic and infinitely more productive to build your own scanning tunneling microscope than to buy commercial products commonly available in the market will be shown.
